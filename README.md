Beer Roulette
Welcome to Beer Roulette - a fun game designed to spice up your hangout sessions with friends. This application is a modern twist to the classic "spin the wheel" game, where the stakes are... beers!

Overview
Beer Roulette lets you play a simple game with your friends where you spin a wheel to decide how many beers one should have. The application comes with a predefined set of options but fear not, you can customize the list to your liking!

Features
Spin to Win (or Drink!) - Click the Spin button and wait for the wheel to decide your fate.
Customizable Options - You're not just stuck with the predefined beer numbers. Click on "Change roulette items" to add, modify, or remove items from the wheel.
Modern UI - With a clean interface and animations, it's not just a game but an experience!
How to Use
Starting the Game: Once you load up the app, you'll be presented with the wheel and a spin button.
Changing the Options:
Click on the "Change roulette items" button at the top right corner.
A pop-up will appear with the current list of options. Modify them as you see fit.
To remove an item, click the "Delete" button next to it.
To add a new item, type in the text field at the bottom of the pop-up and click the "Add Item" button.
Once done, close the pop-up to get back to the main screen.
Playing the Game:
Press the "Spin" button and wait to see what the wheel has in store for you!
